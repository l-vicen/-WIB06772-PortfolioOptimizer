    MVO = 'Mean-Variance Optimization derives from the modern portfolio theory (MPT), which was published by Harry Markowitz in 1952 \
        and for which he received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.  The mean-variance-optimization helps the investor to compose a \
        portfolio that has a maximized expected return on a certain level of risk (portfolio variance). When you plot every (multiple) \
        possible combination of your portfolio in a graph with risk (standard deviation) on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis, \
        the left-boundary of the plotted portfolios create parabola-like shape. The vertex-portfolio will be the closest point to the y-axis. \
        Every portfolio on the left-boundary from the vertex upwards has the highest expected return to a certain risk level thus is pareto efficient.'

    SHARPE_RATIO = 'The Sharpe ratio is an index for the performance of the portfolio. It is defined as the risk-free return subtracted from the \
    expected return divided by the risk (standard deviation) of the returns.'
